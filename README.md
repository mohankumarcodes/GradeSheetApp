# GradeSheetApp
ASP.NET Core Web API, CsvHelper, LINQ, C#, JSON, Dependency Injection Designed and developed a RESTful Web API that allows faculty to upload student score sheets in CSV format and automatically calculates per-student average percentages, assigns letter grades (A‚ÄìF), and computes class-level statistics such as average and standard deviation.

	‚Ä¢ Grade Sheet Web APP
	This ASP.NET Core Web API application allows lecturers to upload a CSV file containing student scores and automatically calculates:
		‚Ä¢ Each student's average percentage
		‚Ä¢ Their corresponding letter grade (A‚ÄìF, based on configurable thresholds)
		‚Ä¢ The overall class average and standard deviation
	‚úÖ Supports optional logic to exclude the lowest score for each student via query string.
	
	‚Ä¢  Features
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Upload CSV file with dynamic column headers
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Calculate average percentage per student
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Assign letter grade based on grade boundaries from appsettings.json
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Compute class average and standard deviation
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Optional flag to exclude each student‚Äôs lowest mark
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ JSON result sorted by highest percentage
		‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Testable via Swagger UI

	‚Ä¢  Technologies Used
		‚Ä¢ ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
		‚Ä¢ CsvHelper for CSV parsing
		‚Ä¢ LINQ for calculations
		‚Ä¢ Swagger (Swashbuckle) for interactive API UI
	
	‚Ä¢ CSV Input Format
		‚Ä¢ 1st column: Student ID (e.g., S001)
		‚Ä¢ Remaining columns: Numeric scores (any number of assessments)
	Example:
	StudentId,Quiz1,Quiz2,Final
S001,70,60,64
S002,55,68,61.5
S003,78,72,76
	
	‚Ä¢ Grade Boundaries Configuration
	In appsettings.json:
	
	"LetterGrades": {
  "A": 90,
  "B": 80,
  "C": 70,
  "D": 60,
  "E": 50
  // Below 50 ‚Üí F
}

	You can change these values as a teacher/admin without touching any code.

	‚Ä¢ Application Flow
		1. Lecturer opens Swagger UI.
		2. Uploads a .csv file via POST /api/gradesheet/calculate.
		3. Chooses whether to ?exclude-lowest=true.
		4. API:
			‚óã Parses and validates file
			‚óã Computes each student‚Äôs average and grade
			‚óã Calculates class stats (average, std. deviation)
		5. Returns a sorted JSON response with all results.
